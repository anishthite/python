#Instructions:

#Input the tax, meal, and tip


tax = input("What's the tax in decimal form? ")
meal = input("What's the meal cost?")
tip = input("What's the tip in decimal form?")
tax_meal = int(meal) + int(meal) * int(tax)
total_meal = int(tax_meal) + int(tax_meal)* int(tax)
print (total_meal)
input()
